***Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Solutions***

This chapter introduced us to Reliability, Scalability and maintainability, alongside what *functional and non-functional requirements* are. 

Reliability: Make systems that work correctly, even when faults occur (different from failures). Faults include Software, hardware and humans. 

Scalability: How we can keep performance high, even when load increases. In a scalable system, you can add processing capacity to remain reliable under load. We also talked about twitter, and how novel scaling problems require creative solutions. 

Maintainability: Making life better for the engineers by making your code extensible, abstracted where needed, and having good visibility into the system (Telemetry).

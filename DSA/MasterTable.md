| Memoization (Top-Down DP)        | Optimization Technique where you store the results for expensive function calls are return the results when the same inputs occur again.You start from the main problem, and recursively break it down, with a lookup table to not need to recalculate. | Use it when you have a**recursive solution with overlapping subproblems**.                                                                                                                                            | The problem asks for the "minimum," "maximum," "longest," "shortest," or "number of ways" for a given set of inputs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Tabulation (Bottom Up DP)        | An iterative approach that solves the problem by filling a**DP table (often an array)** from the bottom up. It builds a solution from the smallest subproblems to the main problem, using loops instead of recursion.                                   | se it when you want to avoid**recursion overhead (like stack overflow)** or when a clear, iterative solution from a base case is more natural. It's often **more space-efficient** and faster than memoization.       | G**rid/Table State** : The problem involves two or more changing parameters, making a 2D or 3D DP table a natural fit. Think of problems on strings, grids, or two-item dependencies.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I**terative Logic** : The solution for a larger subproblem `dp[i]` can be directly calculated from the results of smaller, already-solved subproblems, like `dp[i-1]` or `dp[i-2]`, using loops.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />S**pace Optimization Potential** : The problem's recurrence relation only requires the results from a few preceding states, suggesting that you can optimize the space from an entire DP array down to just a few variables. |
| State Compression                | A technique that reduces the state space in DP by representing complex states with a single integer or a smaller data structure.**Bitmask DP** is the most common form, where a bitmask represents a subset of items or a selection.                    | Use it when the problem's state can be concisely represented by a bitmask, such as when dealing with**subsets, combinations, or permutations** where the number of elements is small (typically **n\*\***≤\***\*20**) | **Small `n`:** The number of items is very small (**n\*\***≤\***\*20**), making exponential time complexity (**O\*\*\*(\*\*\*2\*\***n\***\*⋅\*\***n\***\*)** or similar) feasible.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />**Subsets/Combinations:** The problem involves finding a solution by considering all possible **subsets** of items, like picking a group, or visiting a set of place.<br /><br />**"Used/Unused" State:** You need to keep track of a boolean state for each item, like whether it has been used or included. This can be directly mapped to a bit in an integer.                                                                                                                                 |
| Kadane's Algorithm               | A dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently finds the**maximum sum of a contiguous subarray** within a one-dimensional array. It's a highly optimized, single-pass DP solution for a specific problem type.                                        | Use it to find the**maximum contiguous sum in an array** or in related problems where a similar "running sum" logic can be applied, such as finding the maximum sum submatrix.                                        | 1**D Array:** You are working with a single array of numbers.**ontiguous Subarray:** The problem specifically requires the subarray elements to be adjacent.**Maximum Sum:** The goal is to find the largest possible sum, not the minimum or count. **Reducible Problem:** The problem can be broken down into a series of "maximum contiguous subarray sum" calculations, like with 2D arrays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

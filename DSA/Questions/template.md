# Problem: Name and Link (Two Sum - LeetCode)

#### Date: The date you failed it.

#### Pattern Category: The pattern you identified (e.g., Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers).

## My Flawed Approach: A single sentence on why your initial attempt failed. (e.g., "My brute-force nested loop was O(n^2) and timed out.")

## The Key Insight: The golden nugget you found in Step 1. (e.g., "Use a HashMap to store the complement (target - number) and its index. This allows for a single pass and O(1) lookup.")

### Optimal Code: Paste the clean, commented code you wrote after understanding the solution. Comment the critical lines that implement the "key insight."

#### Complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(n). You must know this. No exceptions.

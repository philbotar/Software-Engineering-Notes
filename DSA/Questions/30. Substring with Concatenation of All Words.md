# Problem: [Substring with Concatencation of All Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

#### Date: 8/9/2025

#### Pattern Category: Sliding Window

## My Flawed Approach: Attempted to get the available words to decrease over time by finding correct permutations recursively. Worked but did not meet the TC.

## The Key Insight: The golden nugget you found in Step 1. (e.g., "Use a HashMap to store the complement (target - number) and its index. This allows for a single pass and O(1) lookup.")

### Optimal Code: Paste the clean, commented code you wrote after understanding the solution. Comment the critical lines that implement the "key insight."

#### Complexity: Time: O(n), Space: O(n). You must know this. No exceptions.
